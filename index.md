hi there! this is 20+ part blog series where i explain in detail, everything i've learnt in deep learning so far. 

we will start from basics and build things up step by step. 

its not going to be a lame surface-level theoretical blog, but instead a in-depth explanation with the math to back it all up..

i have referenced mitesh khapra's deep learning lectures and ian goodfellow's deep learning book and some other random sources
