## Part II: brains to bytes - journey from neurons to perceptrons
imagine your brain as a bustling metropolis, with trillions of neurons playing the role of its inhabitants. these neurons are the ultimate multitaskers, constantly processing information, making decisions, and passing on messages.

here’s the deal:

*dendrites* are like antennas, receiving signals from other neurons. 

*synapses* are the connection points where neurons “talk” to each other. 

*soma* processes the incoming signals, like a central office handling information. 

*axons* transmit the processed signal to the next set of neurons.

this interconnected network forms a hierarchy. at the base, neurons might detect simple edges or corners (think: your brain spotting the outline of a cat). higher up, they start combining this information to recognize patterns or even, say, a fluffy tail.
