# ensemble learning (the more the merrier)

while training an ml model, we all run into the age-old struggle of balancing the bias-variance tradeoff—it’s like trying to eat healthy while also craving dessert.  

one of the techniques used in ml to lower both bias and variance at the same time is **ensemble learning**. 
okay, don’t let the term scare you—it’s actually a super simple concept.  

ensemble learning is based on a very common idea called **wisdom of the crowd**. 
basically, instead of relying on a single model, we bring together multiple weak models (models that perform just a little better than random guessing), and somehow, they combine forces to create a much stronger and more accurate model. 
think of it like a group project where nobody is a genius, but together, they somehow manage to get an a.

ensemble learning is used in ml because:  

1. **better accuracy** – multiple weak models combine to make a stronger, more accurate model. kinda like how a group of average students can somehow ace a project together.  

2. **reduces overfitting** – individual models might overfit to specific data, but when combined, they generalize better. think of it as getting multiple opinions instead of trusting just one person.  

3. **handles bias-variance tradeoff** – it helps balance bias (oversimplification) and variance (overfitting), making the model more reliable. basically, it’s the ml version of "work smarter, not harder."  

4. **more robust predictions** – since it takes input from multiple models, it’s less likely to make extreme mistakes. like how a jury makes better decisions than just one judge.

for example, this this image, we combine outputs from three different models to get a more accurate model.
